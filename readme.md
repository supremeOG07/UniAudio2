# UniAudio 2.0: A Multi-task Audio Foundation Model with Reasoning-Augmented Audio Tokenization

## Abstract

In this work, we present UniAudio 2.0, a multi-task audio foundation model that unifies speech, sound, and music understanding and generation within a single framework. A key component of UniAudio 2.0 is our proposed ReasoningCodec, which tokenizes audio into reasoning tokens and semantic tokens. Reasoning tokens capture descriptive, interpretable attributes (e.g., linguistic content, emotion, style, acoustic scene), while semantic tokens encode structural and fine-grained acoustic details necessary for faithful reconstruction.
For generation tasks, UniAudio 2.0 adopts a reasoning-first prediction strategy: the model first predicts reasoning tokens, providing human-interpretable descriptions that enhance interpretability and predictive accuracy, and then generates semantic tokens to synthesize high-fidelity audio. This design enables UniAudio 2.0 to move beyond transcription-centric modeling, incorporating paralinguistic information (emotion, timbre, tone), environmental context, and non-linguistic sounds, which are often neglected in prior text–audio foundation models.
By integrating ReasoningCodec into a unified audio foundation model, UniAudio 2.0 establishes a comprehensive framework for multi-domain audio tasks. Experimental results show that UniAudio 2.0 improves both understanding and generation across diverse modalities, advancing the goal of general-purpose audio foundation models.
